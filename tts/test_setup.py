"""RUN the mod's Lua against a stubbed Tabletop Simulator, and count cards.

    python3 test_setup.py        # exit code = number of failed assertions

`lupa` embeds a real Lua, so the setup script does not have to be read and
believed - it can be executed. This stubs the slice of the TTS object API
the setups use (bags, decks, takeObject, putObject, shuffle, and a Wait
that fires immediately) and then presses every setup button at all four
difficulties and all four tiers: 64 setups.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The setups stopped being announcements on 2026-11-09 and
started performing the printed mixes, which means they can now be wrong in
a way no amount of reading catches - a deck short by one card at Nobulous
and right at Standard. The alternative was a human counting four decks at
sixteen combinations.

COUNTS ARE NOT ENOUGH, and the tier assertions below are the reason this
file is longer than it looks like it should be. BAT Tier II takes 6
ordinary Upgrades out and puts 6 Modifications in: a Tier II that did
nothing at all leaves exactly the same number of cards. So the tier checks
name the cards rather than counting them.

NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR TTS. This runs Lua 5.4 and Tabletop Simulator runs
MoonSharp, a 5.2 dialect; this proves the script parses and that its card
arithmetic is right, not that TTS will spawn the objects on time. The
sequencer's frame delays are exactly what a stub cannot test, so HANDOFF
step 6 still wants a human at the table.

# PINNED TO 5.4, AND THE PIN IS THE POINT. lupa 2.8 defaults to its new

# an unbound function where a bound method belongs: every pack-up step
# then dies on "'function' object has no attribute 'getName'" and cards
# stay on the table. That cost most of an afternoon, because it looked
# exactly like a mod bug - rare, order-dependent, and always in the same
# feature. Measured across repeated runs: 5.4 and 5.3 are clean, 5.5
# fails in about one process in four, and 5.2 - the closest to the
